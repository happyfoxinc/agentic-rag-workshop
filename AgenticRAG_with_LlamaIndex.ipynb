Outputs can include citations of original sources, allowing human verification.\n",
        "3. ***Providing domain-specific, relevant responses***: Using RAG, the LLM will be able to provide contextually relevant responses tailored to an organization's proprietary or domain-specific data.\n",
        "4. ***Being efficient and cost-effective***: Compared to other approaches to customizing LLMs with domain-specific data, RAG is simple and cost-effective. Organizations can deploy RAG without needing to customize the model. This is especially beneficial when models need to be updated frequently with new data.\n"
