Bumrah was born on 6 December 1993 into a Sikh Punjabi family in Ahmedabad, Gujarat.[5] His father, Jasbir Singh, ran a chemical business, while his mother, Daljeet Bumrah, worked as a school teacher. His father passed away when Bumrah was 5 years old due to hepatitis B.[6][7] His mother raised him and his sister Juhika in a middle-class environment in Ahmedabad. Bumrah attended Nirman High School in Vastrapur, Ahmedabad, where his mother worked as the vice principal. He also played cricket for Nirman's team.[8][9][10]
In 2010, Bumrah appeared at the Gujarat Cricket Association's Under-19 district selection trials. The selectors did not include him in the main squad of 15 due to his unconventional bowling action but named him as a reserve. After the district team won the first three matches, all three reserve players were given a chance in the fourth three-day match. Bumrah took seven wickets in that match.[11]
Bumrah made his twenty20 (T20) debut for Gujarat against Maharashtra in the 2012–13 Syed Mushtaq Ali Trophy, and helped his side clinch the title with his Man of the Match performance in the final, with figures of 3/14 to beat Punjab.[12] On 18 March 2013, during the match against Mumbai, former India coach John Wright, who was then the head coach of Mumbai Indians (MI) and scouting for the team at the time, was impressed by Bumrah's performance and invited him to sign up for MI.[10]
Bumrah played first-class cricket for Gujarat and made his debut against Vidarbha in October 2013 during the 2013–14 season, where he took seven wickets for 89 runs.[13] During the 2015–16 Vijay Hazare Trophy, after the first two matches, the umpires called him for throwing and raised objections about his bowling action. The issue was resolved when the team management protested against it.[11] Gujarat won the trophy, with Bumrah taking a five-wicket haul in the final against Delhi.[14] On 11 December 2020, he scored his maiden first-class half century (55 not out) against Australia A during the India tour of Australia.[15]

Let me go on record and say that he [Jasprit Bumrah] is the best bowler in the world at this stage and the best is yet to come hopefully.
– Sachin Tendulkar, after Bumrah's performance in the 2019 IPL Final[119]Bumrah began his 2018 IPL campaign with a single dismissal in the first match against the Chennai Super Kings, finishing with figures of 1/37.[120] His best performance came in the match against the Kings XI Punjab, where he took 3 wickets for 15 runs at an economy rate of 3.75 runs per over, for which he was named player of the match.[121] In the match against RCB in Mumbai, he took his 50th wicket of his IPL career, dismissing Chris Woakes.[122] Bumrah took 17 wickets in the season, making him the second leading wicket-taker for Mumbai, behind Hardik Pandya.[123] In the 2019 season of the IPL, Bumrah suffered a shoulder injury in the first match against Delhi Capitals. However, he was declared fit the next day and continued to play for the rest of the season.[124] In the match against RCB, he was awarded the player of the match for taking 3 wickets for 20 runs.[125] In the final against Chennai Super Kings at Uppal stadium, Bumrah conceded 14 runs, took two wickets (Ambati Rayudu and Dwayne Bravo), and was awarded the player of the match. Following his performance in the final, Sachin Tendulkar called him the best bowler in the world.[119] He finished the season as the leading wicket-taker for the Mumbai Indians, taking 19 wickets in 16 matches at an average of 21.52 and an economy rate of 6.63 runs per over.[126]
In the 2020 IPL, which was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic,[127] Bumrah took his highest number of wickets in a season, with 27 wickets, making him the highest wicket-taker for the Mumbai Indians and the second-highest wicket-taker of the season behind Kagiso Rabada of Delhi Capitals.[128][129] He took two four-wicket hauls in the season.[130] During the match against RCB at Abu Dhabi, he became the 16th bowler to pick 100 wickets in the IPL with the wicket of Virat Kohli.[131] In the qualifier against Delhi Capitals, he took 4 wickets for 14 runs and won the player of the match award.[132] Bumrah was once again the leading wicket-taker for his team in the 2021 season with 21 wickets in 14 matches and was the third-highest wicket-taker of the season.[133][134] On 19 September 2021, in the match against CSK, Bumrah played in his 100th IPL match.[135] In the 2022 season, Bumrah took 15 wickets in 14 matches at an average of 25.53 and an economy rate of 7.18, making him the highest wicket-taker for Mumbai.[136] He took a five-wicket haul during the match against Kolkata Knight Riders in Navi Mumbai, finishing with figures of 5/10, the best figures of his IPL career.[137] Bumrah was ruled out of the 2023 season of the IPL due to a back injury.[138]
Bumrah took his 150th IPL wicket, dismissing Abhishek Porel, during the 2024 season in the match against DC.[139] In the match against RCB, he achieved his second five-wicket haul, finishing with figures of 5/21.[140] Bumrah ended the season with a total of 20 wickets, making him the third-highest wicket-taker of the tournament.[141]
Bumrah gained prominence with his unorthodox action and hyperextended elbows.[142] His run-up is short, the first part of which consists of small, stuttering strides. He has an anomalous, stiff-armed action yet generates high pace, and his unusual point of release makes it difficult for batters to read his bowling. Accordingly, the Indian team often uses him in powerplay and death overs.[143] He bowls outside the off-stump, yorkers and short length balls frequently.[144][145] According to former international bowler Shoaib Akhtar, Bumrah's bowling action has the potential to cause back injuries. Bumrah's front-on bowling action means that bowlers like him generate speed primarily from their shoulders and back, increasing the risk of injury.[146]
I think Jasprit Bumrah is very, very interesting. He runs off a very short run-up. He jogs and then bowls with a very short run. He has got straight arms. His bowling is not textbook by any means, but it works. He is very different from other pace bowlers, which reminds me of another fast bowler of my era, who was very different from everyone else – Jeff Thomson.
– Former Australian fast bowler Dennis Lillee, December 2018[147]Bumrah targets the stumps more often than any other bowler who bowls at his pace, nearly 138 kilometres per hour (86 mph). He bowls nearly 43% of his deliveries on a good line and length.[148] He has the highest average pace among bowlers who hit the good line and length at least as frequently.[149][150] Additionally, he utilises lateral movement of the ball in his deliveries, capable of swinging it both ways and using reverse swing, especially in Indian conditions.[151]
Bumrah's hyper-extended right elbow allows him to release the ball from beyond the bowling crease, creating the illusion of increased speed by reducing the ball's travel distance by nearly half a meter.[152] This hyperextension also enables him to impart an extraordinary amount of backspin on the ball, which produces lift towards the batter (see Magnus effect).[153] His slower variation, the off cutter, has dismissed many batters over the years. Its effectiveness stems from his ability to reverse the lift by imparting enough revolutions on the ball in the opposite direction, causing the ball to dip which makes it land slightly earlier.[154] Another notable skill is his ability to hit various lengths without significantly altering his release point, making it difficult for batters to pick the length from his hand.[155] Additionally, his beyond-the-perpendicular release point allows him to angle the ball into right-handed batters and away from left-handers from over the wicket.[156]
Bumrah has earned a reputation for his late-swinging yorker, which he says he learned by practising with a tennis ball.[150][157] Bumrah has grown into an asset for the Indian team in the limited-overs format.[158][159][160] He is considered one of the fastest Indian bowlers, with an average speed of 142 km/h and his fastest recorded speed being 153 km/h which was recorded during the first Test match of the India Tour of Australia 2018 at the Adelaide Oval, outpacing Mitchell Starc and Pat Cummins.[161][162]
"My all-time favourite bowlers are Mitchell Johnson, Wasim Akram and Brett Lee. I used to watch their videos and learn from them. I have learnt a lot from Johnson, and Malinga too. I try to learn from any senior bowlers who have played international cricket."Mumbai Indians bowling coach and former New Zealand fast bowler Shane Bond said: "Boom's action, though unique, is repeatable. He has great control."[10] Former Indian fast bowler Ashish Nehra also commented on Bumrah's bowling action, stating, "What you do in 75–80% of your run-up, nothing matters. It's the last 15–20%, the last four-five steps, which is the main thing. That is bowling. Bumrah runs differently, but in his last three-four steps – he is loading, front leg, back leg, everything is in alignment, and he is quick through the air."[10]
On 15 March 2021, Bumrah married model and presenter Sanjana Ganesan in Goa.[164] Hailing from Pune, Maharashtra, Ganesan is a former Miss India finalist and was also a participant in MTV's Splitsvilla in 2014.[165] Bumrah and Ganesan first met in an interview during the 2013 Indian Premier League. They became friends after that first meeting, and after dating for two years, they married in 2021.[166] On 4 September 2023, the couple welcomed their son.[167]
According to Forbes India, in August 2023 Bumrah had around 25 million followers on social media, including over 10 million on Instagram, which is the highest social media following among bowlers in the world. Financial advisory firm Kroll placed Bumrah in the top 45 most valued celebrities of the country, with an estimated brand value of ₹100 crore (equivalent to ₹106 crore or US$13 million in 2023) in the year 2022. He was the only bowler in the top 50.[168] As of August 2023[update], he charges in the range of ₹1.5 to ₹2 crore a day for an endorsement. His brand value is estimated to increase by 25 to 30 per cent in the next 12 months.[169] Forbes India included Bumrah in its Celebrity 100 list in the years 2018 and 2019.[170][171]
Bumrah won the Polly Umrigar Award for best male cricketer for India twice, in 2018–19 and 2021–22.[172][173] Additionally, he received the Dilip Sardesai Award for taking the highest number of wickets in Test cricket in 2018–19.[174] For his achievements during India's tour of England in 2021, he was selected by Wisden Cricketers' Almanack as one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year in its 2022 edition.[175] Bumrah was conferred with The Times of India TOISA Cricketer of the Year award in 2021.[176]
