Yashasvi Jaiswal was born on 28 December 2001 in Suriyawan, Bhadohi, Uttar Pradesh, as the fourth of six children,[2] to Bhupendra Jaiswal, the owner of a small hardware store, and Kanchan Jaiswal, a housewife. At the age of ten, he moved to Mumbai to receive cricket training at Azad Maidan. He was initially given accommodation in a dairy shop in return for work but was evicted by the shopkeeper as he was unable to work frequently due to his practice schedules. As a result, he lived in a tent with the groundsmen at the Maidan,[11] where he sold panipuri to make ends meet.[12]
After living in tents for three years, Jaiswal's cricketing potential was spotted in December 2013 by Jwala Singh, who ran a cricket academy in Santacruz. He provided Jaiswal with a place to stay,[2][13] before becoming his legal guardian and obtaining his power of attorney.[11]
Jaiswal first came to prominence in 2015 when he scored 319 not out and took 13/99 in a Giles Shield match, an all-round record in schools cricket in India.[14][15] He was selected for the Mumbai under-16 squad and later the India national under-19 cricket team.[14] He scored 318 runs and became player of the tournament at the 2018 Under-19 Asia Cup which India won.[16][17]

His innings included 17 fours and 12 sixes[23][24] and he was one of the top five run-scorers during the competition, scoring 564 runs in six matches at a batting average of 112.80.[25] He was named in the India B squad for the 2019–20 Deodhar Trophy.[26]
In the 2020 IPL auction, he was bought by the Rajasthan Royals[27] and made his Twenty20 cricket debut for the side on 22 September 2020. He made his maiden T20 half-century against Chennai Super Kings on 2 October 2021, the second fastest in franchise history at the time,[28][29] and his maiden T20 century on 30 April 2023, scoring 124 from 62 balls against Mumbai Indians and recording the 2nd highest score in IPL match at the Wankhede Stadium.[30] On 11 May 2023 he hit the fastest Indian Premier League (IPL) half-century in just 13 balls against Kolkata Knight Riders, surpassing the previous record jointly held by KL Rahul and Pat Cummins. He finished the 2023 Indian Premier League as Rajasthan's leading run scorer with 625 runs in 14 matches.[31]
In June 2023, Jaiswal received his maiden call up to India's Test squad for the series against the West Indies.[32] He made his debut in the first Test of the series, hitting a century while opening the batting with a score of 171 runs. He also received the Player of the Match award.[33] He made his T20I debut in the 3rd match of the T20I series against West Indies in August 2023.[34] He scored his maiden T20I half-century –84* off 51 balls – in the fourth match of the series while sharing a 165-run opening partnership  with Shubman Gill.[35][36]
In January 2024, he was selected in India's squad for the 5-match Test series against England at home.[37] In the first innings of the first Test, he scored 80 runs off just 74 balls.[38] In the second match of the series, he made his maiden double century, scoring 209 runs off 290 balls in the first innings.

Jaiswal came into the IPL during 2020 and he was bought by Rajasthan Royals.[45] However, he didn't play the IPL at all as Rajasthan already had a strong batting lineup. Despite that, they finished bottom of the table with only 6 wins and 8 losses. Jaiswal would again stay with the Royals in 2021, and while in the first match he didn't play, he scored almost 200 runs with 1 fifty against the eventual champions Chennai Super Kings. Despite that, RR did not qualify for the playoffs. The next season was much different, especially for Jaiswal. He only scored 25 runs in the first 3 matches and was dropped for the next 6 matches. The next match against the Delhi Capitals, he scored 19 runs. The following match he led the Royals in scoring, scoring 41 runs against the Lucknow Super Giants. He scored his first 50 the next match, again against the Super Kings. RR did really well that season, finishing second. They qualified for the playoffs, and were instantly looked down on as Hardik Pandya's Gujarat Titans, who easily beat them by 7 wickets. Jaiswal himself was not great, only scoring 3 runs. RR were tested yet again as they faced Royal Challengers Bangalore, and Jaiswal only 21 runs. However, Jaiswal's opening partner, Jos Buttler score a magnificent century, and RR won the match by a comfortable 7 wickets.  In the finals against the Titans, the whole Royals batting lineup flopped and only managed 130, with Jaiswal scoring 22.
In the 2024 IPL, Jaiswal scored an unbeaten 104 to lead the Royals to victory over Mumbai
